# Yuhoo.ai — rebranded Vercel repository

Active repository: `https://github.com/theyukongroup/Yuhoo-ai-erp`. The local website root is `C:\Users\l.leung\Documents\yuhoo-website\nexavoris-source`, containing `app`, `components`, `lib`, and `package.json`. Add that folder with GitHub Desktop → File → Add local repository. The original `NexavorisSite-VercelCompatible` repository is retained as `upstream`; `origin` points to Yuhoo-ai-erp. The older repository instructions below are historical.

The public brand is now Yuhoo.ai and the canonical origin is https://www.yuhoo.ai. See YUHOO_REBRAND_REPORT.md and YUHOO_DOMAIN_MIGRATION.md before deployment. This is the existing Vercel/Supabase application, including restaurant diagnostics and member/admin tools. The repository name and existing integration contracts remain unchanged.

The operational notes below describe the historical Nexavoris deployment. Its old domains, sender addresses, and canonical direction are historical and are superseded by YUHOO_DOMAIN_MIGRATION.md. Do not use the historical cutover steps for the Yuhoo launch. Git repository identifiers and source-sync paths remain accurate historical identifiers.

# Nexavoris website — Vercel-viable copy

**A standard Next.js app, kept deliberately separate from `07 Website\`.**

## Why two copies exist

`07 Website\nexavoris-website\` is built and hosted through **OpenAI's Sites
product**: it uses `vinext` (a beta Vite-based framework), OpenAI's own
`@openai/sites-vite-plugin`, and deploys as a **Cloudflare Worker** via
`wrangler`, with D1/R2 bindings wired in. Its member area signs people in with
OpenAI's **Sign in with ChatGPT**. That stack has no `next` package at all —
`next build` cannot run against it, and Vercel's framework auto-detection would
not recognize it.

**This folder is a port to plain Next.js** — same pages, same components, same
look, same content — with the OpenAI/Cloudflare-specific pieces replaced: `next`
and a standard Tailwind v4 / TypeScript setup for the build, **Supabase** for
sign-in and the database. It builds with `next build` and deploys on Vercel.

**Do not merge these two folders, and do not point this folder's git remote at
`theyukongroup/nexavoris-website`.** They are two separate GitHub repos on
purpose, so a push to one can never silently affect the other. This folder's
`origin` is `theyukongroup/NexavorisSite-VercelCompatible`; the old
`DamianYuDezign/Nexavoris-TestSite` remote is retained as `testsite`.

`07 Website\` is the **primary** copy and is read-only for us — never edit it.
All Vercel-side work happens here.

| | `07 Website\nexavoris-website\` | `10 User Data and Files\Damian\Nexavoris (Vercel Compatible)\` (here) |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | `vinext` (beta) via Vite | Next.js 16 |
| Deploy target | Cloudflare Workers, via OpenAI Sites | Vercel |
| Sign-in | Sign in with ChatGPT (OpenAI Sites) | Supabase Auth, email + password |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) | Supabase Postgres |
| GitHub repo | `theyukongroup/nexavoris-website` | `theyukongroup/NexavorisSite-VercelCompatible` |
| Edit via | OpenAI Codex / Sites | Any normal Next.js workflow |

## Sync state (2026-09-11)

Content is synced through origin commit **`f1e592f` "Restore version 46
homepage headline font"** — everything in the origin's `app/`, `components/`,
`lib/`, `locales/`, `public/`, `db/`, `scripts/` and `admin-csv-templates/`,
including the member platform, administrator dashboard and SEO/GEO control
center. A full file comparison against the origin shows only the deliberate
divergences listed at the end of this file.

The 2026-09-03 note that "the contact form is client-side only" was wrong: it
POSTs to `/api/consultations`, which did not exist here until this sync, so
contact submissions failed on every earlier Vercel build.

## Local development

UI work needs no secrets:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Public pages render without any environment variables. Signing in, the member
area, `/admin` and every `/api/*` route need the Supabase variables below.
**Never put a `.env*` file in this folder** — it is on the shared K: drive, and
company policy forbids credentials there. To run against real services, clone
the repo to local disk (e.g. `C:\dev\`) and run `vercel env pull` there.

**Note on Turbopack:** `dev`/`build` are pinned to `--webpack`. This project
lives on a mapped network drive (`K:\` → `\\UFS-FILE-SERVER\public folder\...`),
and Turbopack's path-containment check gets confused by the two different
Windows path forms for the same UNC location, failing with `Cannot depend on
path ... outside of root directory` even though nothing actually is. Webpack
doesn't have this problem. **Vercel builds from a normal local path and is
unaffected.**

Checks:

```
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/sql-dialect-selftest.mjs   # SQLite -> Postgres translation
npm run audit:seo -- https://<deployment-url>                        # origin's SEO regression script
```

## Deploying

### 1. Vercel project

**Add New → Project → Import** `theyukongroup/NexavorisSite-VercelCompatible`.
No framework preset override is needed. Note the **function region**
(Settings → Functions); the Supabase project should be in the matching region,
because the admin dashboard makes many small database queries per page.

### 2. Supabase (via the Vercel Marketplace)

Vercel project → **Storage / Marketplace → Supabase → create**. The integration
injects the environment variables the code reads:

| Variable | Read by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) | `lib/supabase/config.ts` | |
| `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_…`, or the legacy `…ANON_KEY`) | `lib/supabase/config.ts` | Public key; safe in the browser, but only used on the server here |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | `lib/member-db.ts` | Pooled (transaction-mode) connection |
| `NEXAVORIS_ADMIN_EMAILS` | `lib/admin-auth.ts` | **Add by hand** (Production + Preview): comma-separated bootstrap administrators |

The service-role key, JWT secret and non-pooled URL are deliberately not used
by the app. Every variable is read at request time and a missing one throws
with a message naming it — there are no defaults.

**Apply the schema:** paste `supabase/migrations/20260911120000_nexavoris_member_platform.sql`
into the Supabase SQL editor and run it. It is idempotent. The app never creates
tables; if one is missing, database calls fail with the table names.

**Supabase Auth settings (Authentication):**

- Email provider **on**, **Confirm email on**. Admin bootstrap depends on it
  staying on (see divergence 8).
- Minimum password length **7** — the forms and server actions enforce 7 too
  (`components/auth-forms.tsx`, `lib/auth-actions.ts`, `lib/auth-copy.ts`);
  change all four together. If Supabase's setting is higher, sign-ups that pass
  the form are rejected.
- JWT signing keys: **asymmetric** (the default for new projects), so session
  checks verify locally instead of calling Supabase on every page view.
- **Site URL:** `https://nexavoris.ai` once the domain is live (the Vercel URL
  while testing).
- **Redirect URLs** allowlist: `https://nexavoris.ai/**`, the project's
  production `*.vercel.app` address with `/**`, `https://*-nexavoris.vercel.app/**`
  (preview deployments; the Vercel team is `nexavoris`, project
  `nexavoris-site-vercel-compatible`), and `http://localhost:3000/**`. If a
  link's host is not on this list, Supabase silently substitutes the Site URL
  and the email link breaks.
- **Rate limits:** raise "sign-ups and sign-ins". Sign-in runs in server actions,
  so every request reaches Supabase from Vercel's IP addresses.

**Email templates** (Authentication → Email Templates). Links must land on
`/login/verify`, which redeems the token only when the person presses a button,
so Outlook/Defender link scanners can't use it up. The app passes
`/login/verify?next=…` as the redirect, so the templates append the token:

- *Confirm signup:* `<a href="{{ .RedirectTo }}&token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=email">Confirm your email address</a>`
- *Reset password:* `<a href="{{ .RedirectTo }}&token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=recovery">Choose a new password</a>`

### 3. Resend (sign-in emails)

Resend → add domain `nexavoris.ai` and create its DNS records **at Bluehost**
(DKIM TXT plus the `send.` SPF/MX records). Leave the root MX
(`mail.nexavoris.ai`) untouched — company mail runs through it. Then Supabase →
Authentication → SMTP settings: host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, username
`resend`, password = a Resend API key (stored only in Supabase), sender
`no-reply@nexavoris.ai`, name `Nexavoris`. Raise Supabase's email rate limit
afterwards.

### 4. Domain cutover (after the preview is signed off)

1. Export anything worth keeping from the OpenAI site's `/admin` first. D1 data
   is not migrated: ChatGPT user IDs don't map to Supabase users.
2. Vercel → Domains: add `nexavoris.ai` and `www.nexavoris.ai`, redirecting www
   to the apex (`SITE_URL` in `lib/seo.ts` is the apex).
3. Bluehost DNS: lower the TTL, replace the apex A records (OpenAI/Cloudflare)
   with the value Vercel shows, and add the `www` CNAME it shows. Before
   2026-09-11 `www.nexavoris.ai` had no record at all, which is why "www" had no
   working certificate. Leave MX and TXT records alone.
4. Supabase Site URL → `https://nexavoris.ai`; remove the domain from OpenAI Sites.

## Member platform on Vercel

**Identity.**
- `lib/auth.ts` reads the Supabase session: `getClaims()` for ordinary checks
  (a local JWT check), and `getUser()` where an email address grants access.
- `app/chatgpt-auth.ts` re-exports these under the origin's names
  (`getChatGPTUser`, `requireChatGPTUser`, `chatGPTSignInPath`), so the origin's
  pages copy over unchanged.
- The origin's hard-coded `/signin-with-chatgpt` and `/signout-with-chatgpt`
  links are served by small route handlers of the same name.

**Pages.** `/login` (sign in / create account), `/login/verify` (email links),
`/forgot-password` and `/reset-password`:
- They live under `app/(auth)/` and are server-rendered in all four languages
  from `lib/auth-copy.ts`.
- They are marked `data-no-translate` so the client translator leaves them
  alone, and are noindexed (`robots.ts` already disallows the paths).
- Forms post to server actions in `lib/auth-actions.ts`.

**Data.**
- `lib/member-db.ts` implements the part of the D1 API the origin uses
  (`prepare/bind/first/all/run`, `batch`) on postgres.js, so the origin's API
  routes are byte-identical here.
- `lib/sql-dialect.ts` converts `?` placeholders and `INSERT OR IGNORE`, and
  **throws on any other SQLite-only syntax**, so a re-sync that introduces some
  fails loudly instead of misbehaving.

**Session refresh and request hygiene.** In `proxy.ts`:
- Refreshes expiring sessions (Server Components can't write cookies).
- Rejects cross-site POSTs to `/api/*`.
- Refuses requests carrying `oai-authenticated-*` headers.

**Security rules — keep them true:**

- Every table in `public` has row level security **enabled with no policies**
  and no grants to `anon`/`authenticated`. The app connects as the owner
  (which bypasses RLS). The public key must never be able to read member data
  through Supabase's REST API. Check with:
  `select relname from pg_class c join pg_namespace n on n.oid = c.relnamespace where n.nspname = 'public' and c.relkind = 'r' and not c.relrowsecurity;`
  (must return no rows).
- Administrator access via `NEXAVORIS_ADMIN_EMAILS`, or via an email-address
  staff grant, requires a **confirmed** email.
- Suspension is enforced by the member/admin APIs (origin behaviour) and also at
  sign-in.

## Re-syncing from the origin

There is no automatic sync. When the origin changes:

1. Copy changed files with `git -C "<origin>" show HEAD:<path> > <path>`. Both
   working trees are CRLF while git stores LF, so plain file diffs look like
   every line changed; compare with `diff --strip-trailing-cr` or
   `git diff --stat <last-sync> HEAD` in the origin.
2. **Never copy** `app/chatgpt-auth.ts`, `lib/member-db.ts`, `lib/admin-auth.ts`
   or `proxy.ts` wholesale — merge by hand (divergences 6–9).
3. **Schema:** run `git -C "<origin>" diff <last-sync> HEAD -- lib/member-db.ts .openai/drizzle db/schema.ts`.
   Any change needs a new timestamped file in `supabase/migrations/` that also
   enables RLS and revokes `anon`/`authenticated` on new tables. New tables are
   caught at runtime (the adapter checks `db/schema.ts`); new columns are not.
4. Re-apply divergences 1–5 and 11, run `npm run build`, update the sync state above.

## Deliberate divergences from the origin

Re-apply these after any re-sync from `07 Website\nexavoris-website`:

1. **Pricing CSS collision fix** — `extended.css` and `theme-v2.css` define
   `.pricing-grid` / `.price` / `.popular` globally, so `/pricing` and
   `/website-design` corrupt each other. Fixed by scoping the website-design
   rules under `.pricing` (18 selectors in `extended.css`, 9 in `theme-v2.css`).
   When the origin changes either file, merge rather than copy. On 2026-09-11 the
   origin's new "AI ERP pillar content" block was appended to `extended.css`.
2. **`app/fixes.css`** — `:focus-visible` outlines and a
   `prefers-reduced-motion` guard. The origin's `layout.tsx` is used as-is
   **plus `import './fixes.css';`** after `member.css`.
3. **`public/llms.txt`** — AEO file, this copy only.
4. **`components/contact-content.tsx`** — the origin's `app/contact/page.tsx`
   takes a `messages` prop so `localized-content` can re-render it with
   translations. Next.js 16 validates that a route page's props match
   `PageProps`, so that prop fails type checking. The body lives in
   `components/contact-content.tsx`; `app/contact/page.tsx` is a thin wrapper,
   and `localized-content` imports the component directly.
5. **`localized-content` route-key cast** — the origin casts `routeKey(slug)` to
   `keyof typeof pages`, which excludes `'contact'`, then compares it to
   `'contact'`. That is a type error under `tsc`; widened to
   `keyof typeof pages | 'contact'`. Still live in the origin.
6. **`app/chatgpt-auth.ts`** — Supabase-backed shim with the origin's export
   names. **Never overwrite it:** the origin's version trusts
   `oai-authenticated-user-*` request headers, which any client can send on
   Vercel — copying it would let anyone sign in as anyone.
7. **`lib/member-db.ts`** — the D1-compatible Postgres adapter, with
   `lib/sql-dialect.ts`, `scripts/sql-dialect-selftest.mjs` and
   `supabase/migrations/`. `ensureMemberSchema()` verifies tables instead of
   creating them.
8. **`lib/admin-auth.ts`** — origin SQL unchanged; identity from
   `getVerifiedUser()` and **only confirmed email addresses are trusted** for
   bootstrap and staff binding.
9. **`proxy.ts`** — the origin's `proxy` is renamed `localeProxy`, its two bare
   `NextResponse.next()` calls forward request headers, and a Vercel-only block
   (marked in the file) adds session refresh, the cross-site `/api` check and
   the `oai-*` header refusal.
10. **Vercel-only auth files** (no origin counterpart): `lib/auth.ts`,
    `lib/auth-actions.ts`, `lib/auth-copy.ts`, `lib/env.ts`, `lib/supabase/*`,
    `components/auth-forms.tsx`, `app/(auth)/**`, `app/api/auth/confirm/`,
    `app/signin-with-chatgpt/`, `app/signout-with-chatgpt/`.
11. **Type-check fixes in two origin components** — vinext does not type check;
    `next build` does. `components/member-platform.tsx` casts the opportunity
    results passed to `onSave` (`as ReturnType<typeof buildOpportunities>`), and
    `components/admin-dashboard.tsx` annotates one `.filter((x: string) => …)`
    callback. Re-apply both whenever either file is copied from the origin.

**Retired (2026-09-11):**
- The logo/favicon divergence: the origin now ships the same files since
  `7a1aea6`.
- The unused `components/mobile-nav.tsx` and its CSS: superseded by the
  origin's drawer.
- The member-platform omissions (header Sign In link, optional
  `MobileNavigation` props, `/free-account` removed from the sitemap): all
  restored to origin behaviour.
